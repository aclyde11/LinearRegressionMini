# LinearRegressionMini

Implements stochastic gradient descent in C++ using Eigen (no optimatzations done). 

## Testing
Included is a simple python test script. The script uses Sklearn's regression data generator to run through random tests of various sizes. Then there is return a 1 if the C++ program's thetas are L2 1 of the regression's base thetas.
